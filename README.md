# PROG 02: Represent!

Briefly describe your app here.
####Application Name:####

Find My Reps!

####Description:####

This application allows a user to input a ZIP code (or use their current location) and find detailed information about the Congressional representatives for that area. There is also a Android Watch interface to swipe through representatives, or use a "shake" gesture to select a random location. The next part of the project will use API's to utilize real congressinonal data.
